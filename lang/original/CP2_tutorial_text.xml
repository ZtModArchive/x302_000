      <BeforeRampage>
      Here's a zoo with an Ankylosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus rex. Both are quick to temper, and when they get cranky, they are likely to leave a path of destruction in their wake.

      </clickTranquilize>
      
      <TranquilizeInstructions>
      To tranquilize the rampaging T. rex, aim your tranquilizer gun at it. Once the T. rex is in its sights, keep it there while the power meter fills. When the meter goes green, press SPACEBAR to try to tranquilize the T. rex.  
      </TranquilizeInstructions>

      <TranquilizeComplete>
      Wow! You successfully stopped the rampaging T. rex in his tracks. Now things are back to normal. When dinosaurs rampage, they leave behind rubble that blocks you from rebuilding until you clean it up. Let's crate the T. rex for now. Select the T. rex to crate it.

      <openDodoRecommendations>
      Extinct animals are more sensitive to their surrounding environment than your other zoo animals. They like to be near objects that fit their climate. Since the dodo is a tropical rainforest animal, it would enjoy a misty spring in its exhibit. Click the Zookeeper Recommendations button on the dodo's Info panel.
