      The Hard Way

      <HardWayOverview>
      There are no more extinct animals to adopt! But your guests want to see extinct animals. There's only one way to give 'em what they want. Time to get your hands dirty! See if you can build a 4-star zoo with at least eight different extinct species!
      <p/>
      To get started, build an Extinct Research Lab.

      <HardWayFinishLab>
      Great! Now that you built an Extinct Research Lab, you can start working on getting some extinct animals in your zoo. Since you can't adopt them, use your new lab to create them.
      </HardWayFinishLab>
  
      <HardWayCollectFirstFossil>
      The only way you can obtain extinct animals is by discovering their fossils in your own zoo. Go to the Extinct Research Lab and start searching for fossils. Collect enough pieces to build a fossil in the Extinct Research Lab. You need six pieces from the same animal to construct a full fossil.

      Your guests are happy to see you showing off an extinct animal, and they want to see more.
