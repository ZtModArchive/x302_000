         Welcome to the Zoo Tycoon 2 Tutorials. In the following tutorials, you will learn the basics of how to control the camera. Then you'll move on to construction techniques and accessing all the information available to you about your zoo.



















         <br>So let's get started! Click the check button on this panel to continue.</br>
      </tutorial1_welcome>
      <goalpanelheading>Open the Goal Panel</goalpanelheading>
      <opengoalpanel>Open the Goal Panel by clicking the Scenario Goals Button on the Primary Game Button Panel.</opengoalpanel>
      <opengoalpanelcompleted>Great! Return to the goal panel anytime to see what your current goals are during a Campaign or Challenge game. Now we
      	can learn how to move the camera around the game world. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </opengoalpanelcompleted>
      <closegoalpanelheading>Close Goal Panel</closegoalpanelheading>
      <closegoalpanel>Close the Goal Panel by clicking the X button on the Scenario Goals Panel.</closegoalpanel>
      <goalpaneldisplay>
	Your scenario and challenge goals will appear here when you play a Campaign or Challenge game. Normally
	this panel will update whenever you succeed, or fail, to complete a goal.
	The tutorials are a little different, though, so for now this is the only goal that will appear here!
      </goalpaneldisplay>
      <cameracontrolscrollheading>Camera Controls: Scrolling</cameracontrolscrollheading>
      <cameracontolscroll>Now we need to practice moving the camera around. Scroll the map by using the arrow keys, or the W A S or D keys on your
      	keyboard, or by moving your mouse cursor all the way to any of the map edges.
      </cameracontolscroll>
      <cameracontolscrollcompleted>
      	Scrolling the map will allow you to view and monitor various areas of your zoo. Click the check button on this panel to
      	continue.
      </cameracontolscrollcompleted>
      <cameracontrolzoomheading>Camera Controls: Zoom In or Zoom Out</cameracontrolzoomheading>
      <cameracontolzoom>
      	Zoom in and out using the Camera Control Zoom buttons on the Primary Game Button Panel, or use the mouse wheel if
      	your mouse supports this function.
      	</cameracontolzoom>
      <cameracontolzoomcompleted>
      	Zooming in gives you a close up view of anything in the zoo. Zooming out gives you a better
      	perspective of the overall structure. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </cameracontolzoomcompleted>
      <cameracontrolrotateheading>Camera Controls: Rotate Game World</cameracontrolrotateheading>
      <cameracontolrotate>
      	Rotate the map by using the Camera Control Rotate buttons on the Primary Game Button Panel. You can also hold down the CTRL key or click and hold the left mouse button while moving
      	the mouse to rotate the camera. Go ahead and rotate your view now.
      </cameracontolrotate>
      <cameracontolrotatecompleted>
      	Rotating allows you to view buildings, animals, and guests from different angles. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </cameracontolrotatecompleted>
      <guestmodeheading>Guest Mode</guestmodeheading>
      <guestmode>Enter Zoo Guest Mode by clicking on the Zoo Guest Mode button to the left of the Primary Game Button Panel.</guestmode>
      <guestmodecompleted>
      	In Zoo Guest Mode, you can walk around your zoo by pressing the left mouse button. Normally, when you enter Zoo Guest Mode, the mouse cursor is hidden so that your view is unobstructed. To toggle your mouse cursor on and off or to switch to Photo Safari view, right-click the mouse. For now, though, just click the check button on this panel to continue.</guestmodecompleted>
      <superstaffheading>Staff Mode</superstaffheading>
      <superstaff>
      	You can also take on the duties of a maintenance worker to sweep trash and empty trash cans. When you
      	approach something that you can interact with, it will automatically be selected. Just hit SPACEBAR
      	to perform the action. Now it's your turn! Press the left mouse button or use the movement keys to
      	walk up to a piece of trash  or a trash can and clean it up now.
      </superstaff>
      <superstaffcompleted>
      	Great! You can also perform zookeeper duties in the same way. You can feed and water
      	animals, groom them, heal them and... of course, rake poop. TIP: Doing these things yourself could mean that you
      	don't need to pay a staff member to do it -- very helpful for a financially struggling zoo! Click
      	the check button on this panel to continue.
      </superstaffcompleted>
      <photosafariheading>Photo Safari</photosafariheading>
      <photosafari>
      	Time to check out Photo Safari mode. Click on the Photo Safari View button to bring up the camera.
      </photosafari>
      <photosafaricompleted>
      	In Photo Safari mode, you can use your camera to take photographs of anything in your zoo. Just press SPACEBAR
      	to take a picture. Again, right-click the mouse to toggle the mouse cursor on and off, but for
      	now, just click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </photosafaricompleted>
      <openpeanutcompleted>
      	From here you can change your view to Zoo Guest Mode, Photo Safari Mode, or Overhead Mode. Click the check button on this
      	panel to continue.
      </openpeanutcompleted>
      <overheadmapheading>Overhead View</overheadmapheading>
      <overheadmap>
      	Let's return to the Overhead View. Click on the Overhead View button.
      </overheadmap>
      <overviewmapheading>Overview Map</overviewmapheading>
      <overviewmap>View the Overview Map by clicking on the Overview Map button to the left of the Primary Game Button Panel.</overviewmap>
      <overviewmapcompleted>
      	The Overview Map gives you a broad layout of your zoo. You can quickly jump around from place
      	to place in your zoo by clicking any location on the Overview Map. Click the check button on this
      	panel to continue.
      </overviewmapcompleted>
      <overviewmapcloseheading>Overview Map</overviewmapcloseheading>
      <overviewmapclose>
      	The map legend allows you to toggle various objects on the map on and off. To close the Overview Map and
      	return to the game, click the X button in the lower right corner of the screen.
      </overviewmapclose>
      <zoopediaheading>Zoopedia and Help</zoopediaheading>
      <zoopedia>Press F1 to open Zoopedia.</zoopedia>
      <zoopediacloseheading>Zoopedia and Help</zoopediacloseheading>

   <tutorial2>
      <tutorial2_welcome>



















         In the following tutorial you will learn the basics of construction techniques -- essentially
         how to make a basic exhibit, change the terrain, add animals, and provide paths and buildings for your guests.



















         <br>So let's get started!  Click the check button on this panel to continue.</br>
      </tutorial2_welcome>
      <selectrecyclebuttonheading>Recycle</selectrecyclebuttonheading>
      <selectrecyclebutton>Select the Recycle Objects and Buildings button.</selectrecyclebutton>
      <selectrecyclebuttoncompleted>
      	Great! You can use the Recycle tool to remove unwanted objects from your zoo. Click the check button on
      	this panel to continue.
      </selectrecyclebuttoncompleted>
      <recycletreeheading>Recycle</recycletreeheading>
      <recycletree>
      	Look for the solitary tree inside the rectangular
      	area enclosed by a path (it's marked with an "X" painted in the dirt). The baobab tree is right in the center of this area. Move
      	your cursor over the baobab tree and click on it to recycle it now.
      </recycletree>
      <recycletreecompleted>
      	Good job! You will receive cash for recycled objects, but it will only be a portion of its
      	full purchase price. Note that you cannot recycle animals - that just wouldn't be right! Click the check button on this panel to continue.</recycletreecompleted>
      <selectundoheading>Undo</selectundoheading>
      <selectundo>Whoops! We really wanted that tree. We can get it back though. Click on the Undo button now to undo the recycling that you just did.</selectundo>
      <selectundocompleted>
      	Excellent! You can use undo to reverse the last thing you did -- this is very
      	handy if you find you've made a mistake or just don't like the way something looks. Note that you can
      	only undo the LAST thing you did, but it will undo any action, including an animal placement or terrain change. Click on the check button to continue.
      </selectundocompleted>
      <openconstructionpanelheading>Construction Panel</openconstructionpanelheading>
      <openconstructionpanel>




















         It's time to start building!




















         <p/>




















         Open the Construction Panel by clicking the Construction button.



















      </openconstructionpanel>
      <openconstructionpanelcompleted>
      	The Construction Panel is where you'll go when you want to place fences, paths, zoo buildings, scenery objects and all kinds of other
      	"man-made" objects in your zoo. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </openconstructionpanelcompleted>
      <openfencerectangletoolheading>Fence Placement Rectangle Tool</openfencerectangletoolheading>
      <openfencerectangletool>
      	Fences are the most common way to keep your animals in... and your guests out! Click on
      	the Rectangle Fence Placement button in the Fence Buy panel.
      </openfencerectangletool>
      <openfencerectangletoolcompleted>
      	The Rectangle Mode tool lets you easily create an enclosed habitat area. Click the check
      	button on this panel to continue.
      </openfencerectangletoolcompleted>
      <placefencesheading>Buy Fence</placefencesheading>
      <placefences>Find the rectangular area enclosed by a path (it's the same area where you just replaced the baobab tree). Let's create a fenced area. First select the chain-link fence, then click on the ground to "anchor" the corner. Move your mouse to see a preview of the enclosed area, and click again to
place the fence. Make a fenced area as large as the rectangular area.</placefences>
      <placefencescompleted>
      	Great! Now you have a basic enclosure. Later you can try the Octagonal Placement Mode to make an
      	octagonal shape or the Rubber Band Mode to place single sections. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </placefencescompleted>
      <placegateheading>Staff Gate</placegateheading>
      <placegate>
      	Now it's time to place a gate. Select the staff gate and place it over the fenced area you just made. The
      	gate preview will snap into place when your cursor is over the fence. Just click to insert the gate in that location.
      </placegate>
      <placegatecompleted>
      	You'll want to make sure that your enclosed areas have gates so your staff can get in and
      	care for the animals. Right now we're only using the chain-link fence, but there are all kinds of
      	different fence types. The staff gate will automatically work on any of them. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </placegatecompleted>
      <selectscenerytabheading>Scenery Tab</selectscenerytabheading>
      <selectscenerytab>
      	Click on the Scenery Tab to open the Scenery Buy panel. Here's where you'll find
      	useful and decorative objects that you can place in your zoo.</selectscenerytab>
      <selectscenerytabcompleted>
      	Normally, you'd see many objects on the Scenery Buy panel but, for now, we've
      	narrowed it down to just one - the donation box. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</selectscenerytabcompleted>
      <placedonationboxheading>Donation Box</placedonationboxheading>
      <placedonationbox>
You have a donation box selected. Move your mouse over the world to see a preview. When an item is on your cursor, you can rotate it by using the &lt; &gt; keys. Note the green arrow pointing to it. This shows the side your guests will approach. Make sure it isn't blocked by anything. Click to place the donation box near the fenced area you made earlier.</placedonationbox>
      <placedonationboxcompleted>
   You should place donation boxes near every exhibit. If guests can't find a donation box, their cash will stay in their pockets instead of going into yours. It's often a good idea to place multiple donation boxes so that guests won't be inconvenienced in any way. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
</placedonationboxcompleted>
      <selectpathtabheading>Path Tab</selectpathtabheading>
      <selectpathtab>Click on the Path Tab to open the Path Buy panel.</selectpathtab>
      <selectpathtabcompleted>
      	You'll see that there are a number of different paths that you can choose from. Guests don't so much care what
      	type of path surface is in your zoo, but they do care that there is one! Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </selectpathtabcompleted>
      <placepathheading>Place Path</placepathheading>
      <placepath>Paths work like fences do. Click on the ground to "anchor" the path. Then move the mouse to see a preview of where the path will go. Click again to place it. Notice that the
path in the map is very narrow around the rectangular exhibit area. Place some new path to make it wider for your guests.</placepath>
      <placepathcompleted>
      	You'll want to make sure that your paths lead to your exhibits. Guests stand on paths to view exhibits
      	so if your paths are too far away,  your guests won't see your exhibits. They'll miss out on your great animals, and you'll
      	miss out on their donations. (Yup, you'll want those paths leading to your donation
      	boxes, too!) Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </placepathcompleted>
      <selectbuildingtabheading>Building Tab</selectbuildingtabheading>
      <selectbuildingtab>
      	Click on the Building Tab to access the Building Buy panel... and you guessed it... this is where you'll find buildings to
      	place in your zoo.
      </selectbuildingtab>
      <selectbuildingtabcompleted>
      	You'll find all sorts of buildings on the Building Buy panel, from food and drink stands to restrooms and
      	more. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</selectbuildingtabcompleted>
      <placebuildingsheading>Purchase Buildings</placebuildingsheading>
      <placebuildings>Now purchase a hot dog food stand, a pretzel cart, and a soda drink stand. You already have the hot dog food stand selected. Move your mouse over the zoo to see a preview of the selected object. To select other buildings, just click on them. Notice the green access arrow, which shows side that guests will approach. Go ahead and place one of each building now.</placebuildings>
      <placebuildingscompleted>
      	Guests get hungry, thirsty, and need to use a restroom while visiting your zoo. If you don't provide them
      	with amenities to meet these needs, they may leave prematurely and take their cash with them. Like exhibits and donation boxes, make sure that you have paths leading to all your great
      	amenities! Click the check button on this panel to continue. </placebuildingscompleted>
      <selectpretzelcartheading>Selecting Objects</selectpretzelcartheading>
      <selectpretzelcart>
      	Click on the pretzel cart that you just placed in your zoo to select it. If another object is already on
      	your cursor, you can right-click to clear it.</selectpretzelcart>
      <selectpretzelcartcompleted>
      	Great, you have the pretzel cart selected! Note that an information panel opens up showing the item
      	you have selected. Don't worry about all the things on this panel for now -- we'll come back to this
      	in more detail later. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </selectpretzelcartcompleted>
      <moveselectedentityheading>Moving Objects</moveselectedentityheading>
      <moveselectedentity>
      	Many objects can be moved to other locations (though there are some that can't be). Once you have selected an object, you can use the Pick Up
      	Building button to "pick it up". You can also just click on the object again once it is selected.
      	Now move the pretzel cart to another location.
      </moveselectedentity>
      <moveselectedentitycompleted>
      	Remember, when an item is on your cursor, you can rotate it by using the &lt; &gt; keys or by clicking AND holding the left
      	mouse button while you move the cursor around the screen. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </moveselectedentitycompleted>
      <openanimalpanelheading>Adopting Animals</openanimalpanelheading>
      <openanimalpanel>
      	Click on the Animals button to open the Animal Adoption panel. This is where you'll obtain animals for
      	your zoo.
      </openanimalpanel>
      <openanimalpanelcompleted>Great! Now let's adopt an animal. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</openanimalpanelcompleted>
      <placeanimalheading>Adopt Animal</placeanimalheading>
      <placeanimal>
      	You'll see that you already have the African elephant selected on the Adoption panel. Move your mouse cursor over to the fenced area that
      	you made earlier and click to place the African elephant inside the basic enclosure.</placeanimal>
      <placeanimalcompleted>
      	Excellent! Now you have a new animal. Guests come to see the animals, so if you have no animals, you'll have
      	no guests! Click the check button on this panel to continue.</placeanimalcompleted>
      <selectfoodtabheading>Animal Food Tab</selectfoodtabheading>
      <selectfoodtab>Select the Animal Food Tab to open the Animal Food Buy panel. If you want your animals to thrive,
      	you'll need to make sure they have food and water.</selectfoodtab>
      <selectfoodtabcompleted>
      	All animals require food and water, but they won't eat just anything (will you?). We'll tell you
      	more about how to determine what an animal eats later, but, for now, just click the check button on this
      	panel to continue.
      </selectfoodtabcompleted>
      <placewaterfoodheading>Purchase Food and Water</placewaterfoodheading>
      <placewaterfood>Place a food trough with hay and a food trough with water near the African elephant by clicking on the dish, then clicking inside the enclosure to place it.</placewaterfood>
      <placewaterfoodcompleted>
      	Great! Placing food and water in your exhibits will allow your animals to satisfy their hunger and thirst
      	needs. Remember... a hungry or thirsty animal is not a happy animal! Click the check button on
      	this panel to continue.
      </placewaterfoodcompleted>
      <selectsheltertabheading>Shelter Tab</selectsheltertabheading>
      <selectsheltertab>Select the Animal Shelters Tab to open the Animal Shelter Buy panel.</selectsheltertab>
      <selectsheltertabcompeted>While an exhausted animal might sleep just anywhere, most animals require a shelter to meet their need for privacy. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</selectsheltertabcompeted>
      <researchobjectheading>Research</researchobjectheading>
      <researchobject>
      	Certain advanced objects need to be studied more carefully before you have access to them. You do this by
      	choosing to research the object. Objects that need to be researched have a small beaker
      	appearing over their icon. Press the Research button on the Object Info panel
      	to begin research on an object.</researchobject>
      <researchobjectcompleted>
      	It takes time and money to research an object. Once the research has been completed, the object is available for
      	purchase. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</researchobjectcompleted>
      <placeshelterheading>Purchase Shelter</placeshelterheading>
      <placeshelter>Wait for the elephant house to finish being researched. You can
do other things while objects are being researched. (This would be a great time to take a look around the zoo!). Once the research is completed, select the elephant house, and then move your cursor into your zoo to see a preview of the item. Click to place the shelter in the African elephant's enclosure.</placeshelter>
      <placesheltercompleted>Great! Your animal has a place to go for a little privacy. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</placesheltercompleted>
      <enrichmentpanelheading>Animal Enrichment Tab</enrichmentpanelheading>
      <enrichmentpanel>
      	Select the Animal Enrichment Tab to open the Animal Enrichment Object Buy panel.
      </enrichmentpanel>
      <enrichmentpanelcompleted>
      	Enrichment objects enhance an exhibit area for many species of animals by keeping them
      	active and entertained in their environment. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </enrichmentpanelcompleted>
      <placeopursuitballheading>Pursuit Ball</placeopursuitballheading>
      <placeopursuitball>
      	There are many enrichment objects available in Zoo Tycoon 2, but, for now, we've narrowed the selection down to
      	one. You'll see that you have a pursuit ball selected. Click in the African elephant's enclosure to place the object.
      </placeopursuitball>
      <placeopursuitballcompleted>
      	Different species of animals have different levels of interest in enrichment objects for
      	stimulation. We'll go into more detail later about how to find out about what items
      	stimulate different animals. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </placeopursuitballcompleted>
      <openlandscapingpanelheading>Landscaping </openlandscapingpanelheading>
      <openlandscapingpanel>
      	Open the Landscaping panel by clicking the Landscaping button. The Landscaping panel is where you'll go to modify
      	the "organic" parts of your zoo by changing the terrain, and placing trees, rocks, and other foliage.</openlandscapingpanel>
      <openlandscapingpanelcompleted>
      	The Landscaping panel is also where you have all the tools you'll need to create a proper habitat (also known as a biome) for
      	your animal(s) to live in. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </openlandscapingpanelcompleted>
      <paintsavannahheading>Paint Savannah Biome</paintsavannahheading>
      <paintsavannah>
      	Move through the different biomes by clicking on the arrows until you locate the
      	savannah biome. After you find it, move the cursor into the African elephant's enclosure and click and drag to
      	start painting with land appropriate to the savannah biome.</paintsavannah>
      <paintsavannahcompleted>
      	Great job! Animals prefer to be in exhibits that resemble their natural habitats. Use these biome brushes
      	to paint the terrain that best suits their natural environments. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </paintsavannahcompleted>
      <pausegameheading>Game Pause</pausegameheading>
      <pausegame>You can pause the game whenever you need to. Click the Pause button in the upper left corner or use the P key to pause the game now.</pausegame>
      <pausegamecompleted>
      	Great! If "real life" beckons, you can pause the game and never miss the action. Keep in mind, though, that
 you can also build while the game is paused. This can be helpful if guests or animals move
      	into an area where you want to build -- just pause the game and move them out of the way.
      	Click the check button on this panel to continue.</pausegamecompleted>

      </tutorial3_welcome>
      <selectanimalheading>Select an Animal</selectanimalheading>
      <selectanimal>Let's start by learning how to get more information about animals. Click on one of the animals in your zoo to open its Information panel. Don't forget you can scroll the map around in case an
      	animal isn't currently in view.</selectanimal>
      <selectanimalcompleted>Great! When you first open the Animal Information panel, you'll see a number of icons that indicate the state of the animal's needs. Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </selectanimalcompleted>
      <trackanimalheading>Tracking On</trackanimalheading>
      <trackanimal>Click on the picture of the animal on the Animal Information panel. This enables tracking, and your camera will begin following the selected animal around.
      </trackanimal>
      <trackanimalcompleted>Great! You can also do this for guests and staff, and it's a handy way to see what an animal or person is up to. Click the check button on this panel to continue.</trackanimalcompleted>
      <zoommaponanimalheading>Zoom In</zoommaponanimalheading>
      <zoommaponanimal>Now zoom in on the selected animal to get a better view.</zoommaponanimal>
      <zoommaponanimalcompleted>

























      	Great! A closer view will help you see the animals' "emoticons".
























         <br/>
























         "Er, emoti..what? Is that a disease?"
























         <br/>
























         Nope.
      	Emoticons are how animals tell you about their needs... and we'll tell you more about needs in a sec. When you're all through watching your animal, click
      	the check button on this panel to continue.
























      </zoommaponanimalcompleted>
      <untrackanimalheading>Tracking Off</untrackanimalheading>

      	is ill or, ah, expecting a new addition! Click the check button on this panel to continue.

      <viewanimalbasicneeds_2completed>
      	The icon shown on this tutorial panel represents an animal's thirst. When it's shown with a yellow
      	overlay, it means that the need is pressing. This means that the animal will be soon trying to satisfy this need.

      </viewanimalbasicneeds_2completed>
      <viewanimalbasicneeds_3heading>A Critical Need</viewanimalbasicneeds_3heading>
      <viewanimalbasicneeds_3 />
      <viewanimalbasicneeds_3completed>The icon shown here represents an animal's hunger. When it's shown with a red
overlay, it means that the need is critical and the animal has not been able to satisfy it. This is a good time to check your exhibit area to make sure the right objects, in this case, the right kind of foods, are available.
 Click the check button on this panel to continue.

      	Recommendations panel.
  </closerecommendations>
      <selectkeeperheading>Select a Zookeeper</selectkeeperheading>

      <viewassignmentscompleted>
      	You can assign zookeepers to specific exhibit areas. This will keep them focused on the exhibits that
	you select. If a zookeeper does not have an assignment, he or she will  head for any exhibit that needs
	attention. Depending on your zoo, this could mean they do a lot of walking! Click the check button on this panel to continue.
      </viewassignmentscompleted>
      <selectaddassignheading>Select Add Assignment</selectaddassignheading>
      <selectaddassign>Click on the Add New Assignment button now.</selectaddassign>

      <selectguestcompleted>
      	The Guest Activities and Needs panel shows you what the guest is currently doing along with icons

      <selectzoofinancescompleted>
      	Great! The Income and Expense report will give you a monthly tally of your financial comings and goings. If
      	you're seeing lots of red, your zoo is probably spending more than it's receiving. Remember...green is good,
 and this is one place where you don't want to be looking through rose-colored glasses! Click the check button on this panel to continue.
