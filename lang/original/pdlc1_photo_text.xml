      <PHTRexPhotos>Tyrannosaurus rex the Predator</PHTRexPhotos>
      <PHTRex>
      Scientists from the Operational Paleontology Association would like you to help them settle the debate over the T. rex's eating habits. The scientists feel that while the Tyrannosaurus rex may have obtained some of its food from scavenging, it must also have been a very capable predator. They would like you to take a pair of pictures proving their theory. If you succeed, the publicity created by the photos will attract additional guests to your zoo!
