      <DinosaurZooOverviewShort>Acquire a mighty Tyrannosaurus rex to save your struggling zoo.
      </DinosaurZooOverviewShort>
      <DinosaurZooFame1Overview>When scientists discovered how to bring back dinosaurs using extinct animal recovery techniques, your zoo was one of the first to offer a Styracosaurus exhibit. Attendance skyrocketed for a while, but now guests have gotten bored with your exhibit, and zoo attendance has declined.
      <p/>
		Your zoo's board of directors wants you to display a Tyrannosaurus rex in your zoo, but only the finest zoos can adopt this magnificent predator. Before you can adopt a T. rex, you must improve your zoo's fame rating and attract more guests to your zoo.
      <p/>The board of directors has agreed to fund an aggressive campaign to develop your zoo. If you bring the zoo up to 3 stars of fame, the board of directors will give you a cash grant.
