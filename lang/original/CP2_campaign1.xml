      <PaleoOverview>
      The Paleo Island Repopulation Council wants to provide a happy and healthy home for newly revived extinct species. Because of your zoo's unique location at Paleo Crater, the council would like you to provide them with animals for this project. If you can care for these beautiful extinct species and prepare them for release into the wild on Paleo Island, you can show off your skills as a zookeeper!
      <p/>
      The council wants you to adopt a Bluebuck and meet its basic needs. Do this and the council will make a $5,000 grant to your zoo.  
      </PaleoOverview>

      <DiseaseOverview>
      Now that you've shown you can build extinct exhibits and keep animals happy, you get to build your own zoo from scratch. There are many new challenges that come with building a zoo with extinct animals. Finding extinct animals to adopt, using your Extinct Research Lab, and keeping all your animals happy can be difficult. Can you keep up with all these challenges?
      <p/>
      Your job is to build the best park you can. Keep your animals happy, fed, and healthy, and your guests entertained, educated, and spending money! To start, you need to acquire three extinct animals from different species and meet their basic needs. After you do this, you get a grant to continue building out your park.  
      </DiseaseOverview>
      
      <DiseaseOverviewShort>
      Running a zoo with extinct species in it presents many challenges. Think you can handle it? Complete all scenarios in this campaign to unlock extinct-themed buildings and objects.

      <DiseaseFinishAdoptFirst>
      Well done! Your extinct animal park is coming along nicely. You received a grant of $2,500!
      </DiseaseFinishAdoptFirst>

      <DiseaseDonations1>
      You were approached by a breeder from the Falkland Islands who has been breeding Warrahs. She wants to feature one in your park, but she wants to be sure you can care for it. If you raise $1,500 in donations for your extinct species, you get a free Warrah!
      </DiseaseDonations1>

      <DiseaseDonations1Short>
      Raise $1,500 in extinct animal donations to receive a free Warrah!
      </DiseaseDonations1Short>
      
      <DiseaseFinishDonations1>
      You raised $1,500 in extinct animal donations and your new Warrah is on its way! Check your front gate for a crate containing your Warrah. Meet its basic and advanced needs, and try to keep it healthy.  The breeder will be back shortly to check on the Warrah.
      </DiseaseFinishDonations1>      

      <DiseaseFinishDonations1Short>
      You raised $1,500 and received a free Warrah! Keep it healthy and the breeder will check back shortly.
      </DiseaseFinishDonations1Short>
      
      <DiseaseFailGiftAnimal>
      Oops! Your Warrah breeder came to see how your new Warrah was doing, and it isn't in your zoo anymore! A good zookeeper proudly displays their new animals. You should try this scenario again.
      </DiseaseFailGiftAnimal>
            
      <DiseaseOutbreak>
      Oh no! Your new Warrah has come down with an illness, and it seems to be spreading through your zoo! Your head zookeeper isn't sure what's causing your animals to become diseased. You're going to need some outside help. Identify and take a picture of one of the diseased animals, and the International Veterinary Research Council can help you identify a cure. In the meantime, you might want to try to keep your sick animals away from your healthy ones.
      </DiseaseOutbreak>

      <DiseaseOutbreakShort>
      Document the disease outbreak by taking a picture of a diseased animal.
      </DiseaseOutbreakShort>
      
      <DiseasePhotoFail>
      Oops! You didn't get a picture of a diseased animal! Without this research, you can not win this scenario.
      </DiseasePhotoFail>
      
      <DiseaseFinishOutbreak>
      After sending your pictures to the International Veterinary Research Council (IVRC), the council concluded the disease your animal has contracted is the Litter Bug! Most people and your common animals have built up some immunity to modern bacteria, but your extinct animals haven't. They may be at risk of catching the Litter Bug!
      <p/>
      You need lots of medical supplies and a well-trained staff to contain this outbreak. Start by keeping your extinct animals away from possible sources until the outbreak has passed. You can go into Zoo Guest Mode (press G) to temporarily heal your animals, or you can assign a zookeeper to watch over them. The IVRC donated $5,000 to your zoo to aid you in your efforts.
      </DiseaseFinishOutbreak>      

      <DiseaseFinishOutbreakShort>
      Your extinct animals have the Litter Bug. You&apos;ve received a $5,000 grant to help cure them.
      </DiseaseFinishOutbreakShort>       

      <DiseaseAnimalDeathFail>
      Oh no! One of your animals died! Play this scenario again. Try to keep your animals happy and healthy.
      </DiseaseAnimalDeathFail>  
  
      <DiseaseFindCure>
      The first step back to having a healthy zoo is to contain the disease. Once it's contained, you can start researching a cure.  
      <p/>
      To find a cure, go to the Extinct Research Lab, and then choose the Disease Cure tab. There, your research team can help you find a cure.
      <p/>
      When you find the cure, you can heal your sick animals. They probably need some treatments for their symptoms while they await a cure. Zookeepers can help, but personal attention from you is best. Drop into Zoo Guest Mode, find a sick animal, and attempt to treat its symptoms.  
      </DiseaseFindCure>

      <DiseaseFindCureShort>
      Find the cure to the Litter Bug.
      </DiseaseFindCureShort>

      <DiseaseFinishFindCure>
      You discovered the cure to the Litter Bug! You can now heal all of your sick animals.
      </DiseaseFinishFindCure>

      <DiseaseHealAll>
      Now that you have the cure to the Litter Bug, you can treat all your sick animals. Walk up to them in Zoo Guest Mode and press SPACEBAR to cure them. Your zookeepers are also armed with the cure and can help. You know they are cured when there are no more germs over their heads.  
      </DiseaseHealAll>

      <DiseaseHealAllShort>
      Cure all your sick animals in Guest Mode, or by assigning zookeepers to cure them.
      </DiseaseHealAllShort>      

      <DiseaseFinishHealAll>
      Wonderful work! You eradicated the disease from your zoo! Your remaining animals should be resistant to the disease in the future, but keep an eye on them to avoid new outbreaks. You received a grant of $2,000 to pay for your zoo's medical expenses
      </DiseaseFinishHealAll>

      <DiseaseFinishHealAllShort>
      Your animals are cured, and you received a $2,000 grant to cover medical expenses!

      <IceAgeOverview>
      The mayor wants to renovate and expand the city&apos;s zoo to help attract and educate the city&apos;s children. To do that, he asked you to advise the zoo on designing and building a new Ice Age exhibition.  
      <p/>
      The city acquired an additional parcel of land to build this exhibit, but you have control of the whole zoo. If you can turn this modestly profitable zoo into a world-class facility, you unlock the extinct-themed buildings and objects!
      <p/>
      The cornerstone of an Ice Age exhibition is the woolly rhinoceros. You should acquire a woolly rhino and meet its basic needs. (Hint: The woolly rhinoceros is unlocked for adoption at 3 1/2 stars of zoo fame, but you might be able to get one sooner at the Extinct Research Lab!)
