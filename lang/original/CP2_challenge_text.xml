      <CHBackFromExtinction>
      Ancient Animals Monthly wants to do a feature story about animals brought back from extinction. If you can acquire animals from four different extinct species in the next two months, your zoo's name gets in the headline! Difficulty: Easy 
      </CHBackFromExtinction>

      <CHBackFromExtinctionShort>
      Acquire four extinct species in two months.
      </CHBackFromExtinctionShort>

      <CHBackFromExtinctionSuccessShort>
      You successfully acquired four extinct species! You got $3,500 and your zoo is more famous!
      </CHBackFromExtinctionSuccessShort>

      <CHBackFromExtinctionSuccess>
      You now have four extinct species in your zoo. Ancient Animals Monthly published a glowing review of your zoo, and it's the cover story in this month's issue! Your zoo just got more famous, and Ancient Animals Monthly gave you a $3,500 bonus!
      </CHBackFromExtinctionSuccess>

      <CHBackFromExtinctionFailureShort>
      Because you failed to obtain four extinct species within the two months, Ancient Animals Monthly didn't get their story.  
      </CHBackFromExtinctionFailureShort>

      <CHBackFromExtinctionFailure>
      You didn't acquire four extinct species in the two-month period. Ancient Animals Monthly ran their cover story on a rival zoo! Admissions to your zoo could slow for a while.

      The Aurochs Recovery Association wants to put one of its aurochs in a good home. There's no charge for the animal, but they want to make sure your zoo is a good fit. If you can prove your zoo is safe and financially stable by raising $1,500 in donations for extinct animals over the next two months, you get the aurochs. Difficulty: Easy
      </CHExtinctDonations>

      <CHExtinctDonationsShort>
      Raise $1,500 in donations for extinct animals in the next two months to receive a free aurochs.
      </CHExtinctDonationsShort>

      <CHExtinctDonationsSuccessShort>
      You collected $1,500 in extinct animal donations! Your new aurochs is on its way.
      </CHExtinctDonationsSuccessShort>

      <CHExtinctDonationsSuccess>
      After raising $1,500 in donations, the Aurochs Recovery Association is pleased to send their precious aurochs to your zoo. You can find it in a crate near your zoo entrance.
      </CHExtinctDonationsSuccess>

      <CHExtinctDonationsFailureShort>
      You failed to raise $1,500 in extinct animal donations in the past two months.  
      </CHExtinctDonationsFailureShort>

      <CHExtinctDonationsFailure>
      The Aurochs Recovery Association is concerned that your zoo won't be able to provide a good home for its aurochs. Since you failed to get the $1,500 in extinct animal donations, the association decided not to give you their aurochs.

      <CHQuarantine>
      A neighboring zoo has a sick female %s, and they need your help to nurse it back to health. Their animal has contracted a disease. If you accept this challenge, they will drop off the diseased animal at your zoo's front gate. You can slow or stop the spread of the disease by keeping the diseased animal away from your healthy ones. If you can eradicate the disease from your zoo within two months, you'll receive the animal's male mate free of charge, and you'll receive matching donations for your extinct species during that time. An animal infected with the disease will have a cloud of germs around its head. To cure the animal, go to your Extinct Research Lab and select the Disease Curing tab. Your research team should be able to help you find the cure for the disease. An animal is cured when germs no longer surround it.  

      Difficulty: Challenging
      </CHQuarantine>

      <CHQuarantineShort>
      Uncrate the %s at your zoo gate, cure its disease, and eliminate any disease among the extinct animals in your zoo in two months.
      </CHQuarantineShort>

      <CHQuarantineSeedDisease>
      It spread to another animal in your zoo! Better find that cure -- quick!  
      </CHQuarantineSeedDisease>

      <CHQuarantineSuccessShort>
      You cured the sick %s and eliminated the disease!
      </CHQuarantineSuccessShort>

      <CHQuarantineSuccess>
      You've eradicated the disease from your zoo! Your extinct animals have some immunity to the disease now, but keep them healthy and clean to avoid another outbreak. Your new %s and a check matching the donations you earned for your extinct species are on their way!
      </CHQuarantineSuccess>

      <CHQuarantineDeathShort>
      Oh, no! One of your animals died from the disease.  
      </CHQuarantineDeathShort>

      <CHQuarantineTimeFailureShort>
      You didn't rid your zoo of the disease within two months.  
      </CHQuarantineTimeFailureShort>

      <CHQuarantineDeath>
      Unfortunately, your animals, and even your guests, spread the disease quickly throughout your zoo. Now one of your animals has died. Remember, diseased animals should be kept far away from any guests and other animals so you can cure them without spreading the disease.
      </CHQuarantineDeath>

      <CHQuarantineTimeFailure>
      You were unable to cure the %s and eliminate the disease in two months. You can continue caring for the animal, but its mate is in the care of another zoo. Remember, diseased animals should be kept far away from any guests and other animals so you can cure them without spreading the disease.

      <CHCaptureCavemen>
      Oh, no! Your glacier is melting and five prehistoric cavemen are loose in your zoo! It's up to you to round them up before they escape! Hint: To capture them, go into Zoo Guest Mode. Difficulty: Easy  
      </CHCaptureCavemen>

      <CHCaptureCavemenShort>
      Capture the wandering cavemen before they escape your zoo!
      </CHCaptureCavemenShort>

      <CHCaptureCavemenSuccessShort>
      You captured all the cavemen!  
      </CHCaptureCavemenSuccessShort>

      <CHCaptureCavemenSuccess>
      Because you could account for all your cavemen, you received a $3,000 grant from the International Prehistoric Security Fund -- and another glacier to put anywhere in your zoo.
      </CHCaptureCavemenSuccess>

      <CHCaptureCavemenFailureShort>
      One of your cavemen escaped! You received a $500 fine.
      </CHCaptureCavemenFailureShort>

      <CHCaptureCavemenFailure>
      One of your cavemen escaped into a nearby park. A park ranger captured him and brought him back to your zoo. Unfortunately, your caveman violated a city ordinance against carrying big clubs, so you received a $500 fine!

      <CHFossilBuilding>
      Researchers at the local science museum recently came across a collection of fossil pieces in storage. They need your help in putting these pieces together. They know that the fossilized bones are from the %s. If you assemble the pieces in one month or less, they are going to give you the research needed to create that animal in your Extinct Research Lab. They are asking for a $2,000 deposit, in case you aren't able to piece together their fossil. Don't worry -- you get the $2,000 back if you succeed. Difficulty: Easy
